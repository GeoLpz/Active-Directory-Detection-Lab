# Active-Directory-Detection-Lab

## Objective

The Active Directory Detection Lab project aimed to simulate a real-world brute-force attack against a Windows Active Directory environment and detect it using Splunk, demonstrating end-to-end log creation, event correlation, and SIEM analysis in a controlled lab setting. 

### Skills Learned

- Practical experience with SIEM tools, using Splunk to detect and analyze security events 
- Configured and managed a Windows Active Directory environment in a virtual lab
- Analyzed Windows Security Logs (Event ID 4625) to identify failed login attempts
- Simulated real-world attack scenarios using Hydra and xfreerdp
- Strengthened troubleshooting and problem-solving skills in networked environments

### Tools Used

- Splunk for centralized log ingestion, event correlation, and alerting 
- Windows Server for Active Directory setup, domain control, and event logging
- Kali Linux for attack simulation and security testing
- Hydra for automated RDP brute-force attempts
- xfreerdp for remote desktop protocol testing and access validation
- VirtualBox for creating and managing isolated virtual environments 

## Steps

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key steps I took to build, configure, and test the Active Directory detection lab.


### Lab Overview / Architecture

Ref 1: Diagram illustrates the virtual lab environment used to simulate and detect Active Directory attacks. All systems are hosted in VirtualBox and configured on the same NAT Network (192.168.10.0/24) for internal communication.

Ref 2: All machines (Kali Linux, Target Machine, Windows Server, and a Splunk Server) are running in VirutalBox.

Ref 3: Configured all VMs on the same NAT Network (AD-Project) to simulate a real AD environment with internal lateral movement and monitoring. 


### ‚öôÔ∏è Splunk Server Configuration

### 1. Static IP Configuration

Ref 4: Used Netplan to assign static IP address to the Splunk server for consistent log forwarding.

### 2. Splunk Installation and Startup

Ref 5: Navigated to Splunk install directory and started the service manually using `./splunk start`.

### 3. Enable Boot-Time Startup

Ref 6: Configured Splunk to run automatically on system reboot using the `enable boot-start` command.
