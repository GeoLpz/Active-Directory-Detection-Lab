# Active-Directory-Detection-Lab

## Objective

The Active Directory Detection Lab project aimed to simulate a real-world-brute-force attack against a Windows Active Directory environment and detect it using Splunk, demonstrating end-to-end log creation, event correlation, and SIEM analysis in a controlled lab setting. 

### Skills Learned

- Practical experience with SIEM tools, using Splunk to detect and analyze security events 
- Configured and managed a Windows Active Directory environment in a virtual lab
- Analyzed Windows Security Logs (Event ID 4625) to identify failed login attempts
- Simulated real-world attack scenarios using Hydra and xfreerdp
- Strengthened troubleshooting and problem-solving skills in networked environments

### Tools Used

- Splunk for centralized log ingestion, event correlation, and alerting 
- Windows Server for Active Directory setup, domain control, and event logging
- Kali Linux for attack simulation and security testing
- Hydra for automated RDP brute-force attempts
- xfreerdp for remote desktop protocol testing and access validation
- VirtualBox for creating and managing isolated virtual environments
